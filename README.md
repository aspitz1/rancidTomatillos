## Tech Stack
* React
* React Router
* Sass
* Cypress
* Webpack
* Git
 
## Context
* First completed project from mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design (Front End 2205)
* Project was completed within a week and a half among a group of two remote contributors
* Utilized asynchronous workflow relying on code reviews within pr requests, daily standups, project board tickets, and slack.
* Learning goals:
   * Gain familiarity with building module React components
   * Understand React Router
   * Make API calls with React
   * Familiarity with Sass
   * Write tests with Cypress
 
## Wins/Challenges
* The limitation placed upon us for this project was to only use class components instead of hooks in order to learn the basic fundamentals of React.
* This made incorporating React Router especially difficult and we had to find unique solutions to the problems this restriction created.
* This was also our first project where we used Cypress, and we consider that a big win because of the possibilities and efficiency end-to-end testing enables.
* We both got more familiar with the React workflow and making components work together.
* We also really leaned into the asynchronous workflow with this project. We are much more comfortable with the PR and code-review process.
 
## Future Additions 
* Support for users to log in and save their favorite movies
* When the app loads, having the movies organized by genre
* Improving performance
